### Description

Represents an amount of money.  __Important:__ Unlike version 1 of the Connect API, __all monetary amounts returned by v2 endpoints are positive.__ (In v1, monetary amounts are negative if they represent money being paid _by_ a merchant, instead of money being paid _to_ a merchant.)
